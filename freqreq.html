                        <h3>Can I Have Some Help Getting Started?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Sorry slugger, no can do! Some things we just have to do for ourselve in order to grow, and this is one of them.
                            Have you ever watched a Butterfly emerging from its cacoon, sport? It struggles and struggles to break free, and so
                            you may think we should help it, right? We could easily take a knife and cut it free of its bonds, and think ourselves
                            heros! That is until the poor, malformed creature flops out weakly, unable to fly. You see, breaking free of its cacoon
                            is how the butterfly builds the strength it needs to fly, and to deprive it of this trail is to leave the creature
                            crippled for life. What seems a kindness turns out to be only an invitation to care for the creature the rest of its
                            sad little life, as it won't have the strength to care for itself. Like the butterfly, you too must struggle, lest you
                            end up a freeloader.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Can I Get An Information Request Form?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Well of course you can <i>get</i> one, but that's not really what you're asking is it? You're asking if we'll just <i>give</i>
                            you one. I'm not liking this freeloading attitude, kid. If you want something, you go get it, you don't ask for it to be given
                            to you. If you're smart, hardworking, and just show a little initiative, you can get anything you want. Fend for yourself, kid,
                            don't become a freeloader.
                        </p>

                        <h3>May I Have Some Water?</h3>
                        <p>
                            This is the sort of request only asked by freeloaders. Poliet society often demands we coddle these unproductives, and so many would
                            capitulate to this petulant request. It may seem easier to simply give in, avoid the conflict, just give them what
                            they want. You easily could, it's not like it actually costs you anything. That is, so long as you don't value your
                            dignity. Show some spine damn it, tell that useless parasite to get their own damn water! You worked so hard for
                            everything you have, why should they have to do any less than you did? They haven't earned that water like you. They
                            don't deserve it like you do. They aren't as good as you. A valuable, competent citizen wouldn't have bothered to ask
                            for a handout, they would have had the strength and dignity to get it themselves! This request shouldn't just go
                            ignored. It needs to be punished.

                        <h3>Can You Teach Me How To Throw?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Another frequent request of the entitled and unproductive. Never willing to educate themselves, the incompetent masses
                            demand to be taught. They want their hands held the whole way. They want every little thing explained to them because
                            their tiny malformed brains can't figure anything out without a stronger, more competent mind to guide them. If some
                            parasite asks this of you, you should teach them by throwing things at them, and let their bruses be their only notes
                            on the subject.

                        <p>
                            Among the ranks of the most common requests, none are so profoundly confounding, none so perturbingly disturbing as
                            this. The fundemental lack of understanding, the deep rooted idoicy, the inherent malformation of any mind that would
                            even think to conjure such a question makes one lose faith in humanity. The ones making this request have already
                            shown they are beyond saving. Their inherent misunderstanding of love is so obvious that they have already disqualified
                            themselves from earning it.
