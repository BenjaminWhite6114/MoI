                        <h3>May I Have Some Water?</h3>
                        <p>
                            A common request among freeloaders. Poliet society often demands we coddle these unproductives, and so many would
                            capitulate to this petulant request. It may seem easier to simply give in, avoid the conflict, just give them what
                            they want. You easily could, it's not like it actually costs you anything. That is, so long as you don't value your
                            dignity. Show some spine damn it, tell that useless parasite to get their own damn water! You worked so hard for
                            everything you have, why should they have to do any less than you did? They haven't earned that water like you. They
                            don't deserve it like you do. They aren't as good as you. A valuable, competent citizen wouldn't have bothered to ask
                            for a handout, they would have had the strength and dignity to get it themselves! This request shouldn't just go
                            ignored. It needs to be punished.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Can You Teach Me How To Throw?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Another frequent request of the entitled and unproductive. Never willing to educate themselves, the incompetent masses
                            demand to be taught. They want their hands held the whole way. They want every little thing explained to them because
                            their tiny malformed brains can't figure anything out without a stronger, more competent mind to guide them. If some
                            parasite asks this of you, you should teach them by throwing things at them, and let their bruses be their only notes
                            on the subject.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Will You Still Love Me If I'm Not What You Expected?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Among the ranks of the most common requests, none are so profoundly confounding, none so perturbingly disturbing as
                            this. The fundemental lack of understanding, the deep rooted idoicy, the inherent malformation of any mind that would
                            even think to conjure such a question makes one lose faith in humanity. The ones making this request have already
                            shown they are beyond saving. Their inherent misunderstanding of love is so obvious that they have already disqualified
                            themselves from earning it.
