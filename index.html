                            Woah there slugger, we ask the questions around here. If you've got questions, you gotta go through the proper channels!
                            What are the proper channels? What did I just say about questions? Look kid, do you even know what information is? Think
                            about it, what is the actual definition of information? Had to look it up, didn't you? That's what I thought. Look, you gotta
                            learn to do things the right way. Once you get used to the system, all the answers will come to you, you just gotta wait.

                            those are god damn it. Look, once you get used to the forms and pages, it really does just come naturally. You aren't gunna learn
                            it in a book or edjucational video. Everything you need is right here, and as long as you aren't stupid, it'll be easy enough to
                            figure out for yourself, okay? Just, like, show some initiative and try to do it yourself first.
